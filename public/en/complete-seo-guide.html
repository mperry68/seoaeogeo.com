            <p>Mastering SEO in 2025 isn't just about keywords and backlinks. If you're new to SEO, it can feel overwhelming with so much changing all the time. That's why I've put together a complete step-by-step roadmap to guide you.</p>

            <p>This roadmap includes all the important topics you need to learn SEO. For example, how to do keyword research or how to utilize AI for becoming more productive. With helpful videos linked to most topics, so you won't miss anything or waste time watching hundreds of clickbait & irrelevant videos. Plus, you'll find a PDF below that covers everything from beginner to advanced SEO.</p>

            <p>The PDF is organized into 12 easy-to-follow modules, and each module is broken down into smaller subtopics for better understanding. Whether you're just starting or looking to improve, this guide will help you become confident in SEO.</p>

            <p><strong>Download my free PDF below to help you learn SEO skills for 2025 and build a strong foundation.</strong></p>

            <p>Please note, I've tried my best to include all the important topics an SEO learner should cover. Each topic is broken down into smaller subtopics that you need to learn to become a complete SEO expert.</p>

            <p>If you just want the syllabus, you can download the PDF below. But if you're a self-learner and want to track your progress, I'll also share a sheet link that you can easily copy and use.</p>

            <p>Now let me break down the full set of modules that are essential in learning SEO.</p>

            <h2>Section 1: Working Of Search Engine</h2>

            <p>You should start by understanding the basics of how search engines work and how web pages are indexed. Once you're clear on that, you can move on to learning about page structure and search engine guidelines.</p>

            <p>Keep in mind, having some basic knowledge of programming—like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—is a big plus. It will help you understand page structure better and will also give you an advantage when applying for SEO jobs.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Search Engine Basics:</strong> This topic covers how crawlers scan web pages, how indexing works, and importance of a sitemap.</li>
              <li><strong>Page structure & HTML Tags:</strong> You should learn about title tag hierarchies, the rules for meta tags, and how to format proper heading outlines.</li>
              <li><strong>Content Quality and User Intent:</strong> You should learn how to create content that is relevant and matches user search intent. Once you understand these concepts, you can practice by drafting simple web pages.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Section 2: Keyword Research & Competitive Analysis</h2>

            <p>Keyword research is undoubtedly one of the most important topics in SEO. It forms the foundation of your entire SEO strategy. If you end up choosing the wrong keywords, your efforts can fail, and you won't get the desired results.</p>

            <p>To make this easier for you, I've also created a practical, well-researched video on keyword research. You can start with that to understand the basics clearly.</p>

            <p>While learning keyword research, here are a few key things to focus on:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Keyword Difficulty</strong> – Understand how hard it is to rank for a particular keyword.</li>
              <li><strong>Region</strong> – Focus on location-specific searches for better targeting.</li>
              <li><strong>Competitor Analysis</strong> – See what keywords your competitors are ranking for and analyze their content and backlink profiles.</li>
              <li><strong>Long-Tail Keywords</strong> – Target low-competition, specific phrases with clear intent that are easier to rank for.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This topic also covers the following essential steps:</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Seed Term Generation:</strong> Start by creating a manual list of primary topics and common user questions. Expand this list using related terms from free keyword tools.</li>
              <li><strong>Search Volume & Difficulty:</strong> Check how often a term is searched each month and evaluate its difficulty. Focus on keywords showing growth potential rather than chasing high-competition terms.</li>
              <li><strong>Competitor Benchmarking:</strong> Identify top-ranking sites for each keyword. Analyze how long their content is, how many backlinks they have, and spot opportunities where you can compete.</li>
              <li><strong>Long-Tail Targeting:</strong> Find specific phrases with lower traffic but clear user intent. Create valuable content to answer these queries and build targeted traffic over time.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I understand that keyword research can feel difficult when done manually, but it's the best way to really learn and understand the concepts. Once you get comfortable with the basics, you should also explore tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush.</p>

            <p>These tools can help you with keyword research and many other SEO tasks. However, they come with a monthly subscription, so if you're just starting out, you can skip buying them for now.</p>

            <p>Still, I recommend watching a few videos on how these tools work. It will give you a good idea of how professional keyword research is done.</p>

            <h2>Section 3: On-Page SEO Deep Dive</h2>

            <h3>On-Page SEO Optimisation</h3>

            <p>On-Page SEO is the next important step after keyword research.</p>

            <p>If you're a fresher, your first SEO task is often to optimize website pages. That's why it's crucial to learn how to do proper On-Page SEO.</p>

            </ul>
