            <h2 id="legal-bases">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>
            <p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>
            <p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
            <p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>
              <li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>
              <li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>
              <li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>
              <li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>
              <li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>
              <li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>
              <li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>
              <li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>
              <li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>
              <li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>
            </ul>

            </ul>

            <h2 id="cookies">5. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</p>
            <p>Currently, we do not set any first-party cookies on our website. However, we may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information in the future. Third-party services (such as Google Maps) may set cookies. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our <a href="/en/cookies-policy.html">Cookie Notice</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="how-long">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>
            <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
            <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

            <h2 id="how-safe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</p>
            <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
            <p>Our security measures include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We use industry-standard encryption protocols (TLS/SSL) to protect data in transit. Sensitive data at rest is encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.</li>
              <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We implement strict access controls and authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access personal information. Access is granted on a need-to-know basis and regularly reviewed.</li>
              <li><strong>Secure Infrastructure:</strong> Our systems are hosted on secure, reputable cloud platforms with robust security measures, regular security updates, and monitoring.</li>
              <li><strong>Regular Security Audits:</strong> We conduct regular security assessments, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing to identify and address potential security risks.</li>
              <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> All employees receive security awareness training and are required to follow strict data protection and security protocols.</li>
              <li><strong>Incident Response:</strong> We have established procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents, including data breaches, in accordance with applicable laws.</li>
              <li><strong>Data Backup and Recovery:</strong> We maintain regular backups of critical data and have disaster recovery procedures in place to ensure business continuity.</li>
              <li><strong>Third-Party Security:</strong> We carefully vet third-party service providers and require them to implement appropriate security measures to protect your information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="minors">8. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>
            <p>We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:marc@infradevconsulting.com">marc@infradevconsulting.com</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="privacy-rights">9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> In some regions, such as Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>
            <p>In some regions (like Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (vi) if applicable, to data portability; and (vii) not to be subject to automated decision-making. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
            <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
            <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
            <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
            <p><strong>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>
            <p><strong>Cookies and similar technologies:</strong> Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services. For further information, please see our <a href="/en/cookies-policy.html">Cookie Notice</a>.</p>
            <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a href="mailto:marc@infradevconsulting.com">marc@infradevconsulting.com</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="dnt">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

            <h2 id="us-residents">11. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
            <p><strong>In Short:</strong> If you are a resident of certain U.S. states, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.</p>
